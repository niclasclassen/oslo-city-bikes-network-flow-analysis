## Project proposal

Using the data of oslo city bikes (https://oslobysykkel.no/en/open-data), we want to analyze and visualize the flow between the different bike stations. By doing this we want to analyze:

- The general flow between the station
- If there are differences between times during the day
- If the usage is different between weekdays and weekends
- How long people rent a bike
- Do people mainly leave or arrive at some stations

**Scope**

- Timeframe: 19/04 - 24/04

## Tasks:

**Get started**

- [x] Download data
  - One file per month
  - One file per year
  - One file for all data ()
- [x] Code to transform data to GDF
  - One GDF for all the stations (points)
  - One GDF for all rides (LineStrings)

**Analysis**

- [x] General flow between stations
- [ ] Differences between times during the day/months/years
- [x] Differences between weekdays and weekends
- [x] How long people rent a bike (Niclas)
- [ ] Distribution of bike usage over time
- [x] Do people mainly leave or arrive at some stations
- [x] Growth of station network over time (Manuel)
- [x] Flow changes with expanding network
- [ ] Analasys based on lecture material

**Structuring**
- [ ] Stucture/Clean code
- [ ] Order of analysis

**Report**

- [ ] TBD
