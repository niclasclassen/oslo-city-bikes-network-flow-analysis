## Project proposal

Using the data of oslo city bikes (https://oslobysykkel.no/en/open-data), we want to analyze and visualize the flow between the different bike stations. By doing this we want to analyze:

- The general flow between the station
- If there are differences between times during the day
- If the usage is different between weekdays and weekends
- How long people rent a bike
- Do people mainly leave or arrive at some stations

**Scope**

- Timeframe: 19/04 - 24/04

## Tasks:

- [ ] Download data
  - One file per month
  - One file per year
  - One file for all data ()
- [ ] Code to transform data to GDF
  - One GDF for all the stations (points)
  - One GDF for all rides (LineStrings)

**Analysis**

- [ ] Differences between weekdays and weekends
- [ ] How long people rent a bike
